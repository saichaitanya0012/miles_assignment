## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK (latest stable version)
- Dart SDK
- Firebase account
- Android Studio / VS Code with Flutter plugins

### Firebase Setup
1. Create a new Firebase project at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Enable Authentication and Firestore in your Firebase project
3. Add Android and iOS apps to your Firebase project
4. Download and add the configuration files:
   - For Android: `google-services.json` to `android/app/`
   - For iOS: `GoogleService-Info.plist` to `ios/Runner/`
5. Generate Firebase options file:
   ```bash
   flutterfire configure
   ```

### Project Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd miles_education_task
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. Run the app:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

### Firebase Security Rules
Add these security rules to your Firestore:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /tasks/{taskId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId;
    }
  }
}
```
